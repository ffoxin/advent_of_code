Runner helps running specific puzzles by year and day or day only.
No year means latest available year.

Run latest:
```shell script
./main2.py
```

Run specific Day within latest year, i.e. Day 5:
```shell script
./main2.py 5
```
> If no files for puzzle (day5.py) or data (day5.txt) is available - this files will be created automatically:
> * day5.py created using template
> * day5.txt created empty

Run specific Year and Day, i.e. Year 2017 Day 2:
```shell script
./main2.py 2017 2
```
